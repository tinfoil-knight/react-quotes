Realize this, and you will find strength.","Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them.","The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.","Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.","Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.","The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.","Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart.","The soul becomes dyed with the colour of its thoughts.","It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.","Our life is what our thoughts make it.","Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.","If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.","Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself in your way of thinking.","The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.","The best revenge is not to be like your enemy.","Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.","The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are.","Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good.","Look well into thyself; there is a source of strength which will always spring up if thou wilt always look.","Do every act of your life as though it were the very last act of your life.","What we do now echoes in eternity.","Look back over the past, with its changing empires that rose and fell, and you can foresee the future too.","For it is in your power to retire into yourself whenever you choose.","Perfection of character is this: to live each day as if it were your last, without frenzy, without apathy, without pretence.","The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it.","Remember that very little is needed to make a happy life.","Never esteem anything as of advantage to you that will make you break your word or lose your self-respect.","A man\u2019s worth is no greater than the worth of his ambitions.","Receive without conceit, release without struggle.","Nothing happens to anybody which he is not fitted by nature to bear.","Don't go on discussing what a good person should be. Just be one.","How ridiculous and how strange to be surprised at anything which happens in life","Life is neither good or evil, but only a place for good and evil.","Whatever anyone does or says, I must be emerald and keep my colour.","Humans have come into being for the sake of each other, so either teach them, or learn to bear them.","Do what you will. Even if you tear yourself apart, most people will continue doing the same things.","Though you break your heart, men will go on as before.","If any man despises me, that is his problem. My only concern is not doing or saying anything deserving of contempt.","Whoever does wrong, wrongs himself; whoever does injustice, does it to himself, making himself evil.","Accept whatever comes to you woven in the pattern of your destiny, for what could more aptly fit your needs?","The memory of everything is very soon overwhelmed in time.","A person's worth is measured by the worth of what he values.","Nowhere can man find a quieter or more untroubled retreat than in his own soul.","Because a thing seems difficult for you, do not think it impossible for anyone to accomplish.","Confine yourself to the present.","The things you think about determine the quality of your mind.","Misfortune nobly born is good fortune.","Dig within. Within is the wellspring of Good; and it is always ready to bubble up, if you just dig.","It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.","Be like the cliff against which the waves continually break; but it stands firm and tames the fury of the water around it.","When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive-to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.","When men are inhuman, take care not to feel towards them as they do towards other humans.","Do not be ashamed of help.","To refrain from imitation is the best revenge.","Look to nothing, not even for a moment except to reason.","The world is mere change, and this life, opinion.","It\u2019s the truth I\u2019m after, and the truth never harmed anyone. What harms us is to persist in self-deceit and ignorance.","For outward show is a wonderful perverter of the reason.","Everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be."]}),document.getElementById("root"))},4:function(e,t,o){e.exports=o(10)},9:function(e,t,o){}},[[4,1,2]]]);
